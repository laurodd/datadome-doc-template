# Guidelines for public documentation

This information will be found under https://www.notion.so/datadome/Contributing-to-public-documentation-7ad76d8c6cc240569a0cac4e93e8800d?pvs=4#387fe37f71a94a67868125650e65da27
when we agree on the rules.

## Type of documentation: How-to

### Definition

> Diátaxis identifies four modes of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation.
>
> In Diátaxis, each of these modes (or types) corresponds to a different user need. Each fulfils a different purpose and requires a different approach to its creation.

See https://diataxis.fr/tutorials-how-to/

The public documentation for server-side modules:
- is oriented to a goal: protect the server-side traffic with DataDome
- is formed of a series of practical steps

It is like a cookbook recipe.

### Characteristics

Our documentation should:

- be simple
    - focused on tasks or problems
    - assume the user knows what they want to achieve
    - no digression, explanation, teaching
- build trust
    - be coherent
    - be authoritative

To effectively convey these caracteristics, we can define a few rules.

## Grammar Rules

### Use second person

### Use active voice

### Use imperative

### Use positive sentences

### Use action-oriented verbs

### Use modifiers only when necessary

### Use first person in FAQs

### Start FAQ with How

## Style Rules

### Number steps

### Code
Code block
Use code format for any info that needs to be typed:
Eg: Enter your `APIKEY`

### File names
Use italics (???)

### Page names, sections and buttons
Use bold
Eg: On the **Login** page, click on **Send**

### Links
The text is as part of the sentence (no "here").

### Tables
If the data is too long, set it in a code block

### Lists
Order by importance and then alphabetically

## Spelling rules

### Names and products
DataDome 

###  Capital letters

Sentences end with a period.
Use a comma before the last item in a series.
Don't use (/) to present a choice.
